# Outdoorsy — SXSW Merch Graphic (Logo/Mark) — Creative Brief v1

## Objective
Create a merch-ready **custom Outdoorsy graphic** for **SXSW in Austin** that feels:
- **Outdoorsy** (RV travel, freedom, roadtrip energy)
- **SXSW / Austin** (festival weekend, ATX identity)
- Bold, iconic, and readable at a glance

## Audience
SXSW attendees (music/film/tech), Austin locals + travelers; a design that feels like a legit festival drop, not corporate swag.

## Must Include (Text)
- Outdoorsy
- SXSW
- Austin, TX **or** ATX (we explored both in renders)

## Tone / Style
- Patch/badge energy (merch-native)
- Clean vector shapes, **thick lines**, minimal detail
- Flat 2–3 color screenprint vibe (no gradients)

## Concept Directions (we rendered 12 early comps)

### Direction A — Route Marker “ATX” (recommended)
**Highway shield / route marker** with ATX front-and-center + small RV silhouette + Texas star accent.
- Why: instantly Austin, instantly readable, strong merch silhouette.

### Direction B — Guitar Pick + Road
Guitar pick (music nod) with winding road leading to a tiny RV + Austin star.
- Why: SXSW signal without saying “conference logo.”

### Direction C — Map Pin Campsite
Map pin where negative space forms an RV/campsite scene.
- Why: most “logo-like” and scalable.

## Next Step
Pick the strongest direction (A/B/C). Then we do:
- 3 tightened variations
- colorway set (light/dark)
- embroidery-safe simplification pass
